My journey started back in high school, designing flyers on my smartphone using Canva. Fast forward to my university days, I knew I wanted to go beyond visuals and dive into something more impactful—UI/UX design. That moment felt like stepping into a whole new world, and I haven’t looked back since! </p><p class="mb-8 leading-loose text-[#484848]" data-v-b9d5075a> Now, with 4 years of experience, I work as a Product Designer at Astradrop, helping craft intuitive, user-centered experiences. Over the years, I’ve collaborated with cross-functional teams on diverse projects, from iOS apps to responsive web platforms, even enhancing existing products with thoughtful design improvements. </p><p class="mb-8 leading-loose text-[#484848]" data-v-b9d5075a> I’m naturally curious, always eager to explore, investigate, and learn what I don’t know. My design approach is a mix of creative exploration and structured problem-solving—balancing artistic intuition with a detail-obsessed mindset. Some may call it perfectionism, but I like to think of it as refining the magic until everything just clicks! </p><p class="mb-8 leading-loose text-[#484848]" data-v-b9d5075a> I’ve completed the Google UX Academy and other bootcamps courses to sharpen my UX skills, working on everything from mobile apps to web platforms. Lately, I’ve been diving into AI tools, integrating them into my workflow to speed up processes and enhance creativity. </p><p class="mb-8 leading-loose text-[#484848]" data-v-b9d5075a> I thrive in remote environments, handling complex projects and tight deadlines while collaborating with PMs, engineers, and stakeholders to bring ideas to life. More than anything, I believe great design happens in an open, fun, and collaborative space—so I make sure every team I work with feels just that!@ </p></div><div data-v-b9d5075a><button class="btn text-white rounded-full px-6 py-4 font-switzer-regular text-lg flex items-center gap-2" data-v-b9d5075a> View Resume </button></div></section>',1)),a("section",g,[a("section",p,[s(o(n),{color:"#CACACA",height:"100",icon:"hugeicons:quote-up",width:"100"}),e[0]||(e[0]=t('<section class="grid place-items-center text-start" data-v-b9d5075a><p class="leading-normal text-[#484848] mt-3 text-4xl font-switzer-md" data-v-b9d5075a> I believe <strong class="text-[#A363F6]" data-v-b9d5075a> great design </strong> isn’t just about look, <br data-v-b9d5075a> it’s about <strong class="text-[#FDCA00]" data-v-b9d5075a> creating experiences </strong> that <strong class="text-[#2196F3]" data-v-b9d5075a> guide, <br data-v-b9d5075a> engage </strong> , and <strong class="text-[#2196F3]" data-v-b9d5075a>convert effortlessly</strong> . </p></section>',1)),s(o(n),{class:"float-end",color:"#CACACA",height:"100",icon:"hugeicons:quote-down",width:"100"})])]),e[2]||(e[2]=t('<section class="container max-w-2xl mx-auto px-5 lg:px-2 mt-20" data-v-b9d5075a><div class="mb-14" data-v-b9d5075a><h4 class="font-switzer-md text-4xl mb-8" data-v-b9d5075a>My life outside Design</h4></div><div data-v-b9d5075a><p class="mb-8 leading-loose text-[#484848]" data-v-b9d5075a> When I’m not designing, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech trends, binge-watching a good series, or lost in a deep dive on YouTube about something completely random (like healthy foods to eat 🤯).
